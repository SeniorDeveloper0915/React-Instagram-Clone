# React II

Topics:

 * create-react-app
 * JSX
 * state
 * setState
 * props
 * propTypes (`npm i --save prop-types`)
 * `onClick={}`
 * map
 * functional vs class components


## Project Description

  * Run `npm i -g create-react-app` to install the React app generator.
  * Run `create-react-app instagram` to create your starter application.
  * Create a file called `application-data.js` in `/src` and paste the JS shown below into that file.  This is the data that you will use to populate your components.
  * Build out your application with two main component types: the search bar at the top of the page, and a post container for each Instagram post.
  * Focus less on exact styling and more on the structure of your React components.

  Your search bar should look something like this:
